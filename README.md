## Description

ft_printf is C's printf function recoded from scratch.

Many projects at 19 Coding School consist of recreating core functions in C to develop a practical (rather than theoretical) understanding of what they do. In this case, the aim was to recode C's printf function from scratch, using only other previously recreated functions available in the "libft" folder. See [ft_printf.en.pdf](../master/ft_printf.en.pdf) (or the [FR](../master/ft_printf.fr.pdf) version) for details.
